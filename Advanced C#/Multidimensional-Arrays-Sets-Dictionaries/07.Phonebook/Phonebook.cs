//Write a program that receives some info from the console about people and their phone numbers.
//You are free to choose the manner in which the data is entered; each entry should have just one name and one number (both of them strings).
//After filling this simple phonebook, upon receiving the command "search", 
//your program should be able to perform a search of a contact by name and print her details in format "{name} -> {number}". 
//In case the contact isn't found, print "Contact {name} does not exist." 
//Bonus: What happens if the user enters the same name twice in the phonebook? Modify your program to keep multiple phone numbers per contact
